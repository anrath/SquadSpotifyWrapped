## SquadSpotifyWrapped - Spotify Wrapped For Your Squad (By Kasra)

I wanted a better way to experience my friends&apos;s music so I built it. Open source because why not. Free because it only runs on client.

## Note

This project is currently a work in progress. There are many improvements that should be made, including:

- Better error handling and user feedback
- Improved OCR accuracy and text parsing
- Additional playlist customization options
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing
- Clearing out old playlists
